<p>In recent years, Microservice architecture has been gaining popularity. With that rise, comes a different set of requirements than we had previously. The most important one is efficient communication between the different services. That’s where gRPC comes in. So naturally, this book will show you how to create gRPC servers and clients in an efficient, secure, and scalable way. But, on top of that, because Microservices are not only about communication, this book intends to show you how to deploy your application on Kubernetes and configure other tools that are needed for making your application more resilient. In that way, this book will give you all the tools that you need to start right away with gRPC in a Microservice architecture.</p>

<p>In gRPC Go for Professionals, you’ll begin by learning the core concepts such as how the framework sends messages over the network and why it uses Protobuf for serialization and deserialization. After that, we will implement a TODO list API step by step to see the different features of gRPC. Then we are going to see how to test your services in different ways. We will see how to debug your API endpoints. And finally, we will see how to deploy the application’s services by creating Docker images and using Kubernetes.</p>

<p>For the last decade, we have heard stories about Monolith to Microservice transitions and we might think that this transition solves the majority of the problems in the organizations. However, it might end up with mess if you are not aware about best practices of this transition, since Microservice Architecture comes with its challenges. In this book, we start covering production grade best practices of Microservices Architecture and explain when to use it. Then we talk about microservice communication patterns where gRPC comes to the stage. You will see complete examples written in Go with Hexagonal Architecture applied to project structure. You will not only learn how to implement microservices, you will see how to write tests, maintain quality with proper CI, deploy to Kubernetes environment and finally set up an observable system to have better monitoring for your application.</p>

<p>Go has rapidly become the preferred language for building web services. Plenty of tutorials are available to teach Go’s syntax to developers with experience in other programming languages, but tutorials aren’t enough. They don’t teach Go’s idioms, so developers end up recreating patterns that don’t make sense in a Go context. This practical guide provides the essential background you need to write clear and idiomatic Go.</p>

<p>No matter your level of experience, you’ll learn how to think like a Go developer. Author Jon Bodner introduces the design patterns experienced Go developers have adopted and explores the rationale for using them. This updated edition also shows you how Go’s generics support fits into the language.</p>

<p>This book helps you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Write idiomatic code in Go and design a Go project</li>
  <li>Understand the reasons behind Go’s design decisions</li>
  <li>Set up a Go development environment for a solo developer or team</li>
  <li>Learn how and when to use reflection, unsafe, and cgo</li>
  <li>Discover how Go’s features allow the language to run efficiently</li>
  <li>Know which Go features you should use sparingly or not at all</li>

<p>Use Golang to create simple, maintainable systems to solve complex business problems.</p>

<p>Domain-driven design (DDD) is one of the most sought-after skills in the industry. This book provides you with step-by-step explanations of essential concepts and practical examples that will see you introducing DDD in your Go projects in no time. Domain-Driven Design with Golang starts by helping you gain a basic understanding of DDD, and then covers all the important patterns, such as bounded context, ubiquitous language, and aggregates. The latter half of the book deals with the real-world implementation of DDD patterns and teaches you how to build two systems while applying DDD principles, which will be a valuable addition to your portfolio. Finally, you’ll find out how to build a microservice, along with learning how DDD-based microservices can be part of a greater distributed system. Although the focus of this book is Golang, by the end of this book you’ll be able to confidently use DDD patterns outside of Go and apply them to other languages and even distributed systems.</p>

<p>Go is a popular choice for writing DevOps and systems programs, and command-line tools in particular. How can we write simple, powerful, idiomatic, and even beautiful tools in Go? This book covers all the necessary techniques: functional options, flags and arguments, files and filesystems, executing commands, writing shells and pipelines, JSON and YAML wrangling, and even sophisticated API clients.</p>

<p>Even more importantly, the book teaches you how to <em>think</em> like a master software engineer: how to break down problems into manageable chunks, how to test functions before they’re written, and how to design Go CLIs that delight users.</p>

<p>Understand Kubernetes and other orchestration systems deeply by building your own using Go and the Docker API.</p>

<p>Orchestration systems like Kubernetes coordinate other software subsystems and services to create a complete organized system. Although orchestration tools have a reputation for complexity, they’re designed around few important patterns that apply across many aspects of software development. Build an Orchestrator in Go reveals the inner workings of orchestration frameworks by guiding you as you design and implement your own using the Go SDK. As you create your own orchestration framework, you’ll improve your understanding of Kubernetes and its role in distributed system design. You’ll also build the skills required to design custom orchestration solutions for those times when an out-of-the-box solution isn’t a good fit.</p>

<p>While often considered a fast and compact programming language, Go usually creates large executables that are difficult to run on low-memory or low-powered devices such as microcontrollers or IoT. TinyGo is a new compiler that allows developers to compile their programs for such low-powered devices. As TinyGo supports all the standard features of the Go programming language, you won’t have to tweak the code to fit on the microcontroller.</p>

<p>This book is a hands-on guide packed full of interesting DIY projects that will show you how to build embedded applications. You will learn how to program sensors and work with microcontrollers such as Arduino UNO and Arduino Nano IoT 33. The chapters that follow will show you how to develop multiple real-world embedded projects using a variety of popular devices such as LEDs, 7-segment displays, and timers. Next, you will progress to build interactive prototypes such as a traffic lights system, touchless hand wash timer, and more. As you advance, you’ll create an IoT prototype of a weather alert system and display those alerts on the TinyGo WASM dashboard. Finally, you will build a home automation project that displays stats on the TinyGo WASM dashboard.</p>

<p>By the end of this microcontroller book, you will be equipped with the skills you need to build real-world embedded projects using the power of TinyGo.</p>
