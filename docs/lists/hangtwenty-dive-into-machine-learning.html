<p>Of course, there is no easy path to expertise. Also, <em>I’m not an expert!</em> I just want to connect you with some great resources <em>from</em> experts. Applications of ML are all around us. I think it’s in the public interest for more people to learn more about ML, especially hands-on, because there are many different ways to learn.</p>

<p>Whatever motivates <em>you</em> to dive into machine learning, if you know a bit of Python, these days you can get hands-on with a machine learning <em>“Hello World!”</em> in minutes.</p>

<p>“Machine learning systems automatically learn programs from data.” Pedro Domingos, in <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf">“A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning.”</a> The programs you generate will require maintenance. Like any way of creating programs faster, you can rack up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical debt</a>.</p>

<p>Here is the abstract of <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43146/">Machine Learning: The High-Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Machine learning offers a fantastically powerful toolkit for building complex systems quickly. This paper argues that it is dangerous to think of these quick wins as coming for free. Using the framework of technical debt, we note that it is remarkably easy to incur massive ongoing maintenance costs at the system level when applying machine learning. The goal of this paper is highlight several machine learning specific risk factors and design patterns to be avoided or refactored where possible. These include boundary erosion, entanglement, hidden feedback loops, undeclared consumers, data dependencies, changes in the external world, and a variety of system-level anti-patterns.</p>

<h3 id="peer-review">Peer review</h3>

<p><strong><a href="https://openreview.net/about">OpenReview.net</a></strong> “aims to promote openness in scientific communication, particularly the peer review process.”</p>

<details>
<summary><em>More about OpenReview.net</em></summary>

&gt; * **Open Peer Review:** We provide a configurable platform for peer review that generalizes over many subtle gradations of openness, allowing conference organizers, journals, and other "reviewing entities" to configure the specific policy of their choice. We intend to act as a testbed for different policies, to help scientific communities experiment with open scholarship while addressing legitimate concerns regarding confidentiality, attribution, and bias.
&gt; * **Open Publishing:** Track submissions, coordinate the efforts of editors, reviewers and authors, and host… Sharded and distributed for speed and reliability.
&gt; * **Open Access:** Free access to papers for all, free paper submissions. No fees.
&gt; * **Open Discussion:** Hosting of accepted papers, with their reviews, comments. Continued discussion forum associated with the paper post acceptance. Publication venue chairs/editors can control structure of review/comment forms, read/write access, and its timing.
&gt; * **Open Directory:** Collection of people, with conflict-of-interest information, including institutions and relations, such as co-authors, co-PIs, co-workers, advisors/advisees, and family connections.
&gt; * **Open Recommendations:** Models of scientific topics and expertise. Directory of people includes scientific expertise. Reviewer-paper matching for conferences with thousands of submissions, incorporating expertise, bidding, constraints, and reviewer balancing of various sorts. Paper recommendation to users.
&gt; * **Open API:** We provide a simple REST API [...]
&gt; * **Open Source:** We are committed to open source. Many parts of OpenReview are already in the [OpenReview organization on GitHub](https://github.com/openreview). Some further releases are pending a professional security review of the codebase.

&gt; * [OpenReview.net](https://openreview.net/) is created by Andrew McCallum’s Information Extraction and Synthesis Laboratory in the College of Information and Computer Sciences at University of Massachusetts Amherst
&gt;
&gt; * [OpenReview.net](https://openreview.net/) is built over an earlier version described in the paper [Open Scholarship and Peer Review: a Time for Experimentation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=xf0zSBd2iufMg) published in the [ICML 2013 Peer Review Workshop](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICML.cc/2013/PeerReview).
&gt;
&gt; * OpenReview is a long-term project to advance science through improved peer review, with legal nonprofit status through Code for Science &amp; Society. We gratefully acknowledge the support of the great diversity of [OpenReview Sponsors](https://openreview.net/sponsors)––scientific peer review is sacrosanct, and should not be owned by any one sponsor.

<h2 id="deep-learning">Deep Learning</h2>

<p>Take note: some experts warn us not to get too far ahead of ourselves, and encourage learning ML fundamentals before moving onto deep learning. That’s paraphrasing from some of the linked coursework in this guide — for example, Prof. Andrew Ng encourages building foundations in ML before studying DL. Perhaps you’re ready for that now, or perhaps you’d like to get started soon and learn some DL in parallel to your other ML learnings.</p>

<h2 id="collaborate-with-domain-experts">Collaborate with Domain Experts</h2>

<p>Machine Learning can be powerful, but it is not magic.</p>

<p>Whenever you apply Machine Learning to solve a problem, you are going to be working in some specific problem domain. To get good results, you or your team will need “substantive expertise” / “domain knowledge.” Learn what you can, for yourself… But you should also <strong>collaborate with experts.</strong> You’ll have better results if you collaborate with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject-matter_expert#Domain_expert_(software)">subject-matter experts and domain experts</a>.</p>

<h3 id="machine-learning-and-user-experience-ux">Machine Learning and User Experience (UX)</h3>

<p>I couldn’t say it better:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Machine learning won’t figure out what problems to solve.</strong> If you aren’t aligned with a human need, you’re just going to build a very powerful system to address a very small—or perhaps nonexistent—problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That quote is from <a href="https://design.google/library/ux-ai/">“The UX of AI” by Josh Lovejoy</a>. In other words, <strong><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/false-consensus/">You Are Not The User</a>.</strong> Suggested reading: <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml/#human_analysis_of_the_system">Martin Zinkevich’s “Rules of ML Engineering”, Rule #23: “You are not a typical end user”</a></p>

You also need **understanding.** You should review what Kaggle competition winners say about their solutions, [for example, the "No Free Hunch" blog](http://blog.kaggle.com/). These might be over your head at first but once you're starting to understand and appreciate these, you know you're getting somewhere.

Competitions and challenges are just one way to practice! [Machine Learning isn't just about Kaggle competitions](https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/06/19/machine-learning-isnt-kaggle-competitions).

<summary><strong>Another way:</strong> try doing some practice studies</summary>

Here's a complementary way to practice: **do practice studies.**

1. **Ask a question. Start exploring some data.** The ["most important thing in data science is the question" ![GitHub Repo Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/DataScienceSpecialization/courses) ![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/DataScienceSpecialization/courses)](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/courses/blob/master/01_DataScientistToolbox/03_02_whatIsData/index.Rmd#the-data-is-the-second-most-important-thing) ([Dr. Jeff T. Leek](https://github.com/jtleek)). So start with a question. Then, find [real data ![GitHub Repo Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets) ![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets)](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets). Analyze it. Then ...
2. **Communicate results.** When you think you have a novel finding, ask for review. When you're still learning, ask in informal communities (some are [linked below](#some-communities-to-know-about)).
3. **Learn from feedback.** Consider [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/), it works great for some folks. (Don't pressure yourself yet though! Everybody is different, and it's good to know your learning style.)

How can you come up with interesting questions? Here's one way. Pick a day each week to [look for public datasets ![GitHub Repo Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets) ![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets)](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets) and write down some questions that come to mind. Also, sign up for [Data is Plural](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural), a newsletter of interesting datasets. When a question inspires you, try exploring it with the skills you're learning.

This advice, to do practice studies and learn from review, is based on [a conversation ![GitHub Repo Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/hangtwenty/dive-into-machine-learning) ![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/hangtwenty/dive-into-machine-learning)](https://github.com/hangtwenty/dive-into-machine-learning/issues/11#issuecomment-153934120) with [Dr. Randal S. Olson](http://www.randalolson.com/). Here's more advice from Olson, [quoted with permission: ![GitHub Repo Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/hangtwenty/dive-into-machine-learning) ![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/hangtwenty/dive-into-machine-learning)](https://github.com/hangtwenty/dive-into-machine-learning/issues/11#issuecomment-154135498)

&gt; I think the best advice is to tell people to always present their methods clearly and to avoid over-interpreting their results. Part of being an expert is knowing that there's rarely a clear answer, especially when you're working with real data.

As you repeat this process, your practice studies will become more scientific, interesting, and focused. Also, [here's a video about the scientific method in data science.](https://101.datascience.community/2012/06/27/the-data-scientific-method/))

<blockquote>
  <p>… Bayesian ideas have had a big impact in machine learning in the past 20 years or so because of the flexibility they provide in building structured models of real world phenomena. Algorithmic advances and increasing computational resources have made it possible to fit rich, highly structured models which were previously considered intractable.</p>
