The first part includes the introductions and elementary descriptive statistics; I want the students to be knee-deep in data right out of the gate. The second part is the study of probability, which begins at the basics of sets and the equally likely model, journeys past discrete/continuous random variables, and continues through to multivariate distributions. The chapter on sampling distributions paves the way to the third part, which isinferential statistics. This last part includes point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing, and finishes with introductions to selected topics in applied statistics. Author: G. Jay Kerns.</li>
