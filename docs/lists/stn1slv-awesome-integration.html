<p><em>Integration patterns provide standardized solutions for common integration problems within an enterprise. Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) provide a common language for describing integration problems and solutions, while Integration Architecture Patterns address high-level concerns of enterprise architects. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) patterns provide guidance for designing and implementing service-oriented architectures, ensuring that services are scalable, reusable, and loosely coupled.</em></p>
